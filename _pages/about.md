# üßë‚Äçüéì About Me
+ Born in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, China, I received the B.Eng. degree in **Information Security** from [Hainan University](hainanu.edu.cn) in 2021. Now I am working towards my M.Eng. degree in **Computer Science and Engineering**, [Xidian University](xidian.edu.cn), supervised by [Prof. Kai WU](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/kwu/).
+ My research interests include graph for EA, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, and single-objective evolution algorithm, etc.
+ For more info, please refer to my up-to-date [CV](/files/CV-Huixin MA.pdf).
