# 🧑‍🎓 About Me
+ Born in Jiangxi Province, China, 2001, I am active in life and am willing to be a scientist of data and communication. Deemed to have numerous hobbies, I like playing basketball, playing Go, playing MOBA and I have shown great interests in music and instruments, such as the saxphone and violin.
+ I received the B.Eng. degree in **Optoelectronic Information Engineering** from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](uestc.edu.cn) in 2023 and was awarded as an honorable graduate concerning my contributions to the security of Internet of Things. 
+ Now I am a 1st Ph.D. student of [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](cuhk.edu.cn) in **Computer and Information Engineering**, supervised by [Prof. Feng Yin](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/yinfeng) and [Prof. Tsung-Hui Chang (IEEE Fellow)](https://myweb.cuhk.edu.cn/changtsunghui). My future research will focus on **Network Security, Wireless Sensing, Signal Processing**, as well as the **Machine Learning Methods**.
+ For more information, please refer to the latest version of [CV](/files/CV.pdf).
